# Three-Phase Energy Monitoring System

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive energy monitoring dashboard for tracking three-phase power consumption across multiple machines. The system provides real-time analytics, visualization, and reporting capabilities for both administrators and regular users.

## Features
- **Multi-user authentication**: Secure login system with role-based access control
- **Real-time monitoring**: Track power consumption and production metrics in real-time
- **Interactive dashboards**: Visualize energy data through charts and graphs
- **Machine tracking**: Monitor multiple units/machines from a centralized interface
- **Responsive design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Firebase (Authentication, Database)
- **Visualization**: Chart.js / Custom visualization libraries
- **Deployment**: Vercel / Cloud hosting
